This is an experiment in running OpenStack Swift in containers,
initially in Docker containers. The objective is to vastly simplify
deployment of test clusters in comparison with e.g. traditional SAIO.
No more lengthy, complex, and error-prone instructions. Just fetch
the image and deploy it in 1 invocation of the docker command, done.
